## Sample Programming Projects
| **Project** | **Description** | **Programming Language** |
|:---:|:---|:---|
| [Tiny Search Engine] (https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/tiny-search-engine) | Designed and implemented a search engine that crawls webpages, indexes the contents of the pages, and processes user queries to return all relevant pages in ranked order, akin to Google | C and Bash |
| Sudoku | Developed a sudoku game that generates a random puzzle with a unique solution and solves any sudoku passed by the user | C and Bash |
| Modules | Implemented reusable modules such as set, counters, and hashtable and thoroughly tested their functionality | C and Bash |
| [Part of Speech Tagger](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/POS-tagging-via-Hidden-Markov-Model)| Built a personal digital assistant that classifies each word in a sentence based on its part of speech tag using the Hidden Markov Model | Java |
| [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Huffman-Encoding) | Implemented Huffman encoding to compress and decompress text files using trees, maps, priority queues, and file i/o | Java |
| [Kevin Bacon](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Kevin-Bacon-Game) | Designed the Kevin Bacon game to find the ‚ÄúBacon number‚Äù of actors based on movies they co-starred with other actors using the BFS graph algorithm on a tree | Java |
| [Collaborative Graphical Editor](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Collaborative-Graphical-Editor) | Developed multithreaded server and drawing GUI which enables multiple clients to connect to the server and edit the same canvas simultaneously, akin to Google Docs but for painting | Java
| [Point QuadTree](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/PointQuadTree) | Designed point quadtree to enable faster lookup in two dimensions and detect blob collisions on a GUI | Java |
| [Webcam Painter](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Webcam-Painter) | Built a webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (such as your hand or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush" using the region growing algorithm | Java |
| [Dartmouth Pathfinder](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Dartmouth-Pathfinder) | Designed a mini ‚ÄúGoogle Maps‚Äù for Dartmouth campus locations by creating a graph that models part of the campus, finding the shortest path from one vertex to another, and visualizing the path on the map | Python |
| [Sort Cities](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Sort-Cities) | Implemented the quicksort algorithm to sort 47,913 world cities by population, alphabet, and latitude and visualized the top 50 most populous cities on a world map | Python |
| [Gravity Simulator](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Gravity-Simulator) | Designed and implemented a simulator that animates the motion of stars, planets, or moon | Python | 
| [Atari Pong](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Atari-Pong) | Developed the classic Atari Pong game | Python |
