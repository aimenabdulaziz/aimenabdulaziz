# Introduction 
- 👋 Hi, I am Aimen Abdulaziz.
- 👀 I am interested in computational problem-solving, software development, and machine learning. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning Software Design and Implementation.
- 💞️ I am looking to collaborate on any open-source projects pertaining to my interests. 
- :envelope: You can reach out to me [here](mailto:aimenaabdulaziz@gmail.com).
## Sample Programming Projects
### Java
- [POS Tagging](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/POS-tagging-via-Hidden-Markov-Model) – built a personal digital assistant that classifies each word in a sentence based on its part of speech tag using the Hidden Markov Model.
- [Huffman Encoding](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Huffman-Encoding) – implemented Huffman encoding to compress and decompress text files using trees, maps, priority queues, and file i/o.
- [Kevin Bacon](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Kevin-Bacon-Game) – designed the Kevin Bacon game to find the “Bacon number” of actors based on movies they co-starred with other actors using the BFS graph algorithm on a tree.
- [Collaborative Graphical Editor](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Collaborative-Graphical-Editor) – developed multithreaded server and drawing GUI to allow multiple users connected to the server simultaneously edit the same canvas, akin to Google Docs.
- [Point QuadTree](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/PointQuadTree) – designed point quadtree to enable faster lookup in two dimensions and detect blob collisions on a GUI. 
- [Webcam Painter](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Webcam-Painter) – built a webcam-based painting program in which some portion of the image (such as your hand or a marker tip) acts as a "paintbrush" using the region growing algorithm.

### Python
- [Dartmouth Pathfinder](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Dartmouth-Pathfinder) – designed a mini “Google Maps” for Dartmouth campus locations by creating a graph that models part of the campus, finding the shortest path from one vertex to another, and visualizing the path on the map.
- [Sort Cities](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Sort-Cities) – implemented the quicksort algorithm to sort 47,913 world cities by population, alphabet, and latitude and visualized the top 50 most populous cities on a world map.
- [Gravity Simulator](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Gravity-Simulator) – designed and implemented a simulator that animates the motion of solar system.
- [Atari Pong](https://github.com/aimenabdulaziz/Atari-Pong) – developed the classic Atari Pong game.
